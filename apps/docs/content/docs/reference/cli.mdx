description: Command-line interface reference for all Seashail commands and subcommands.
---

Seashail provides a command-line interface for running the MCP server, managing agent configurations, diagnostics, and upgrades. This page documents all available commands with their flags and usage examples.

> There is NO `seashail wallet` command. Wallet operations are MCP tools only. Use `create_wallet`, `import_wallet`, and other wallet tools via MCP agents.

## seashail mcp

Run the MCP server over stdio. By default this starts a lightweight stdio proxy that forwards to a singleton local Seashail daemon (so multiple agents can share one key and policy state).

### Flags

<TypeTable
  type={{
    network: {
      type: '"mainnet" | "testnet"',
      description:
        "Override config network mode for this session. Affects default chain selection when tools omit chain/chains parameters.",
    },
    standalone: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Run a standalone MCP server in this process (no daemon, no sharing between agents).",
      default: "false",
    },
  }}
/>

### Examples

Start MCP server in proxy mode (recommended):

```bash
seashail mcp
```

Start with testnet override:

```bash
seashail mcp --network testnet
```

Start in standalone mode (no daemon sharing):

```bash
seashail mcp --standalone
```

### Notes

- Proxy mode (default) allows multiple agent processes to share one daemon state (keystore, passphrase session, policy).
- The proxy auto-spawns the daemon if it's not already running.
- Use `--standalone` for isolated testing or single-agent scenarios.
- See [architecture](/docs/reference/architecture) for details on the proxy/daemon relationship.

## seashail daemon

Run the singleton Seashail daemon. The daemon holds the exclusive keystore lock and manages passphrase sessions across all MCP clients.

### Flags

<TypeTable
  type={{
    idle_exit_seconds: {
      type: "integer",
      description:
        "Exit after being idle (no active clients) for this many seconds. If unset, runs until terminated.",
    },
  }}
/>

### Examples

Run daemon until terminated:

```bash
seashail daemon
```

Run daemon with auto-exit after 5 minutes idle:

```bash
seashail daemon --idle-exit-seconds 300
```

### Notes

- You usually don't need to run this manually — `seashail mcp` in proxy mode auto-spawns the daemon.
- The daemon holds an exclusive filesystem lock at `$DATA_DIR/seashail-daemon.lock` to prevent split-brain state.
- When all MCP clients disconnect, the idle timer starts. If `--idle-exit-seconds` is set, the daemon exits after that duration.

---

## seashail paths

Print resolved paths for data directory, config directory, and log file. Useful for debugging configuration issues.

### Flags

No flags.

### Examples

```bash
seashail paths
```

Output (JSON):

```json
{
  "config_dir": "/Users/you/.config/seashail",
  "data_dir": "/Users/you/.local/share/seashail",
  "log_file": "/Users/you/.local/share/seashail/seashail.log.jsonl"
}
```

### Notes

- Paths follow platform conventions (XDG on Linux, macOS Application Support, Windows AppData).
- Override with `SEASHAIL_CONFIG_DIR` and `SEASHAIL_DATA_DIR` environment variables.

---

## seashail doctor

Print a quick self-diagnostic report. The report contains no secrets and is safe to paste in issues or support requests.

### Flags

<TypeTable
  type={{
    json: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Emit JSON to stdout (machine-readable).",
      default: "false",
    },
  }}
/>

### Examples

Human-readable report:

```bash
seashail doctor
```

Machine-readable JSON:

```bash
seashail doctor --json
```

### Notes

- The report includes version info, resolved paths, wallet count, policy summary, and basic connectivity checks.
- Safe to paste publicly — no private keys, passphrases, or addresses are included.

---

## seashail agent list

List supported agent targets for `print` and `install` commands.

### Flags

No flags.

### Examples

```bash
seashail agent list
```

Output (JSON):

```json
[
  { "name": "cursor", "config_path": "~/.cursor/mcp_config.json" },
  { "name": "vscode", "config_path": "~/.vscode/mcp_config.json" },
  { "name": "windsurf", "config_path": "~/.windsurf/mcp_config.json" },
  {
    "name": "claude-desktop",
    "config_path": "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"
  }
]
```

### Notes

- Currently supports Cursor, VSCode, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop.
- Use these target names with `agent print` and `agent install`.

---

## seashail agent print

Print a full JSON config template to stdout for a specific agent target. Use this to inspect the config before installing.

### Flags

<TypeTable
  type={{
    agent: {
      type: '"cursor" | "vscode" | "windsurf" | "claude-desktop"',
      description: "Agent target to print config for.",
      required: true,
    },
    network: {
      type: '"mainnet" | "testnet"',
      description: "Emit a testnet template (seashail mcp --network testnet).",
      default: '"mainnet"',
    },
  }}
/>

### Examples

Print Cursor config:

```bash
seashail agent print cursor
```

Print testnet config:

```bash
seashail agent print cursor --network testnet
```

### Notes

- The output is valid JSON that can be piped to a file or directly installed.
- Templates include the correct `seashail mcp` command with appropriate flags.

---

## seashail agent install

Install a config template to the agent's default config path (or a custom path via `--path`).

### Flags

<TypeTable
  type={{
    agent: {
      type: '"cursor" | "vscode" | "windsurf" | "claude-desktop"',
      description: "Agent target to install config for.",
      required: true,
    },
    network: {
      type: '"mainnet" | "testnet"',
      description:
        "Install a testnet template (seashail mcp --network testnet).",
      default: '"mainnet"',
    },
    path: {
      type: "string",
      description: "Override the target config file path.",
    },
  }}
/>

### Examples

Install to default location:

```bash
seashail agent install cursor
```

Install testnet config:

```bash
seashail agent install cursor --network testnet
```

Install to custom path:

```bash
seashail agent install cursor --path ~/my-config.json
```

### Notes

- If the config file already exists, you'll be prompted to confirm overwrite.
- After installation, restart your agent/editor to load the new config.

## seashail openclaw install

Install or manage the OpenClaw plugin integration. This provides first-class Seashail tools in OpenClaw.

### Flags

<TypeTable
  type={{
    network: {
      type: '"mainnet" | "testnet"',
      description:
        "Session-only network mode for Seashail when invoked via OpenClaw.",
      default: '"mainnet"',
    },
    plugin: {
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Plugin path or npm spec for openclaw plugins install. If omitted, uses repo path (if running from repo) or @seashail/seashail.",
    },
    link: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Link a local plugin path instead of copying (dev-friendly).",
      default: "false",
    },
    openclaw_config_path: {
      type: "string",
      description:
        "Override the OpenClaw config path (defaults to $OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH or ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json).",
    },
    seashail_path: {
      type: "string",
      description:
        'Override the seashail binary path stored in plugin config (default: "seashail" if on PATH).',
    },
    restart_gateway: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Restart the OpenClaw gateway service after install/config update.",
      default: "true",
    },
    enable_in_sandbox: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Allow the Seashail plugin in OpenClaw's sandboxed agent mode (tools.sandbox.tools.allow += seashail).",
      default: "true",
    },
    onboard_wallet: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "After installing/configuring the plugin, ensure Seashail has a default wallet. If no wallet exists, creates a machine-local generated wallet named default with EVM/Solana/Bitcoin addresses (no passphrase prompts).",
      default: "true",
    },
  }}
/>

### Examples

Install with defaults:

```bash
seashail openclaw install
```

Install with testnet mode:

```bash
seashail openclaw install --network testnet
```

Dev install with local plugin:

```bash
seashail openclaw install --link --plugin ./packages/openclaw-seashail-plugin
```

### Notes

- This command runs `openclaw plugins install` under the hood and updates OpenClaw config.
- `--restart-gateway` automatically restarts OpenClaw's gateway to pick up changes.
- `--onboard-wallet` creates a default wallet if none exists, making setup frictionless.

---

## seashail upgrade

Upgrade Seashail to the latest version. If installed via Homebrew on macOS, runs `brew upgrade seashail`. Otherwise, re-runs the hosted installer.

### Flags

<TypeTable
  type={{
    yes: {
      type: "boolean",
      description:
        "Skip the confirmation prompt (required for non-interactive shells).",
      default: "false",
    },
    quiet: {
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Suppress installer output (useful for scripts/cron).",
      default: "false",
    },
  }}
/>

### Examples

Interactive upgrade:

```bash
seashail upgrade
```

Non-interactive upgrade:

```bash
seashail upgrade --yes
```

Silent upgrade (for scripts):

```bash
seashail upgrade --yes --quiet
```

### Notes

- Override auto-detection with `SEASHAIL_UPGRADE_METHOD=brew|installer`.
- The upgrade command checks your current version and only upgrades if a newer version is available.
