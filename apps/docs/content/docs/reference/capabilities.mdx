description: Discover which chains and integrations are available on your machine.
---

Because Seashail is self-hosted and configurable, the set of chains and integrations may differ between machines. Use:

- `get_capabilities`

to get a single JSON object describing:

- effective network mode
- configured chains and RPC endpoints
- optional integrations that require API keys (for example 1inch)
- supported "surfaces" (spot, perps, NFTs)

## Example Use

Call the tool with no arguments:

```json
{}
```

Key fields to look at in the response:

- `network_mode.effective`: `mainnet` or `testnet`
- `chains.solana.supports`: which Solana-specific operations are enabled
- `chains.evm[]`: per-EVM-chain support flags, including whether 1inch is available
- `services.jupiter.api_key_configured`: whether you have configured an optional Jupiter API key
- `services.oneinch.configured`: whether 1inch swaps are enabled (requires an API key)

## How This Relates To Tools

`get_capabilities` is the "truth" for:

- which `chain` strings are configured
- which swap providers are usable on a given chain (Uniswap vs 1inch)
- which NFT surfaces are enabled on EVM vs Solana

If a tool returns `unsupported_chain` or `provider_unavailable`, check `get_capabilities` first.
