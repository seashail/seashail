## What Is Pump.fun

Pump.fun is a Solana-based platform for launching and trading meme coins. Unlike traditional token launches, Pump.fun tokens follow a bonding curve mechanism: the price increases as more people buy, and decreases as they sell. This creates a market-driven price discovery model where supply and demand directly impact the token price in real-time.

Seashail provides 4 tools for Pump.fun interaction:

- `pumpfun_list_new_coins` — discover recently launched coins
- `pumpfun_get_coin_info` — get detailed information about a specific coin
- `pumpfun_buy` — buy a pump.fun token with SOL
- `pumpfun_sell` — sell your pump.fun tokens back to SOL

All Pump.fun tools are Solana-only. You must have a Solana wallet with SOL for gas fees.

## Discovering New Coins

Use `pumpfun_list_new_coins` to see recent token launches. This tool returns a list of coins sorted by launch time (newest first).

The response includes:

- Mint addresses (used for buying/selling)
- Token names and symbols
- Descriptions
- Creation timestamps
- Bonding curve progress and market cap

You can configure the number of results (up to 200 coins).

This is a read-only operation — no policy approval needed.

## Getting Coin Details

Use `pumpfun_get_coin_info` with a coin's mint address to fetch detailed information about a specific token.

The response includes:

- Name, symbol, and description
- Creator address
- Market cap and bonding curve status
- Virtual SOL and token reserves
- Associated bonding curve account addresses

This data helps you evaluate the coin's state before trading. Read-only — no policy approval needed.

## Buying Coins

Use `pumpfun_buy` to purchase a pump.fun token. The trade is executed against the bonding curve smart contract.

Required parameters:

- `mint` — the token's mint address (identity-checked for safety)
- `amount_sol` — the amount of SOL you want to spend

Optional parameters:

- `wallet` — if omitted, uses your active wallet
- `account_index` — if omitted, uses your active account index
- `usd_value` — optional override for policy approval evaluation

Buy operations are subject to policy evaluation:

- `enable_swap` must be `true` in your policy
- Transaction value is checked against `max_usd_per_tx` and daily caps
- Tiered approval applies (may be auto-approved, require confirmation, or be blocked based on USD value)

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how tiered approval works.

### Typical Buy Workflow

1. Discover coins: `pumpfun_list_new_coins`
2. Investigate a specific coin: `pumpfun_get_coin_info` with the mint address
3. Buy: `pumpfun_buy` with mint and SOL amount
4. Confirm if prompted (via MCP elicitation)

Example buy:

```json
{
  "mint": "ABC123...",
  "amount_sol": 0.5
}
```

This spends 0.5 SOL to buy the pump.fun token at the current bonding curve price.

### Bonding Curve Mechanics

The bonding curve means:

- The more you buy, the higher the price rises for subsequent buyers
- Large buys can significantly move the price
- Price impact depends on the size of your buy relative to the curve's reserves

## Selling Coins

Use `pumpfun_sell` to sell your pump.fun tokens back to SOL.

Required parameters:

- `mint` — the token's mint address (identity-checked)
- `percent` — percentage of your holdings to sell (0-100)

Use `percent: 100` to sell your entire position.

Sell operations are subject to the same policy controls as buying.

Example sell:

```json
{
  "mint": "ABC123...",
  "percent": 100
}
```

This sells 100% of your holdings for that token, receiving SOL back at the current bonding curve price.

## Risk Considerations

**Pump.fun trading carries extreme risks. Only trade with capital you can afford to lose completely.**

### Volatility

Meme coins can lose 90% or more of their value in minutes. Price movements of 50%+ in either direction within seconds are common. The bonding curve mechanism amplifies volatility: large sells crater the price, large buys spike it.

### Rug Pulls

Token creators can dump their holdings at any time, often after initial hype drives up the price. This is extremely common in the meme coin space.

### Liquidity Risk

Bonding curve tokens may have very thin liquidity. Large sells can move the price dramatically downward — you may receive far less SOL than expected.

### No Fundamental Value

Most meme coins have no underlying utility, revenue, or real-world use case. Value is driven purely by speculation and sentiment.

### Policy Safeguards

Use policy controls to limit exposure:

- Set conservative `max_usd_per_tx` limits
- Use `max_usd_per_day` to cap daily meme coin spending
- Consider separate per-wallet policy overrides for experimental trading

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for configuration details.
