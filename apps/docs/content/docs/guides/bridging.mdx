title: Bridging Tokens
description: Transfer tokens between Solana and EVM chains using Wormhole and LayerZero.
---

`bridge_tokens` moves tokens between chains: Solana ↔ EVM, or EVM ↔ EVM. Two bridge providers are supported: Wormhole and LayerZero. Bridging is asynchronous — the transaction is initiated on the source chain, and tokens arrive on the destination chain after confirmation.

Policy evaluation applies: bridging is a write operation with the same tiered approval as sends.

## How Bridging Works

1. You call `bridge_tokens` with source chain (`chain`), destination chain (`to_chain`), token, and amount
2. Seashail executes the bridge transaction on the source chain
3. The bridge provider relays the transaction to the destination chain
4. If `redeem: true` (default), Seashail attempts to auto-redeem on the destination chain (requires destination chain gas)
5. You receive tokens on the destination chain

Bridging is NOT instant. Confirmation times vary by chain (minutes to hours).

## Supported Routes

- **Solana → EVM:** Wormhole or LayerZero
- **EVM → Solana:** Wormhole or LayerZero
- **EVM → EVM:** Wormhole or LayerZero (e.g., Ethereum → Arbitrum)

Not all token/chain combinations have routes — check `get_capabilities` for available routes.

## Bridge Providers

### Wormhole (Default)

Broad token support, guardian-based security. Use `bridge_provider: "wormhole"` or let auto-select.

### LayerZero

Ultra-light nodes, fast finality on supported routes. Use `bridge_provider: "layerzero"` explicitly.

If no provider is specified, Seashail defaults to Wormhole.

## Checking Bridge Status

Bridging is NOT instant — confirmation times vary by chain.

Use `get_bridge_status` to track your bridge transfer. Provide the transaction signature as `bridge_id` along with the `bridge_provider`.

### Status Flow

1. **Initiated:** Transaction submitted on source chain
2. **Confirmed on source:** Source chain finality reached
3. **Relayed:** Bridge provider relayed to destination chain
4. **Completed:** Tokens arrived on destination chain

See [Read Tools Reference](/docs/reference/tools-read#get_bridge_status) for details.

## Typical Workflow

1. Check balances on source chain: `get_balance`
2. Bridge: `bridge_tokens` with `chain`, `to_chain`, `token`, `amount`
3. Note the bridge transaction ID from the response
4. Check status: `get_bridge_status` with the transaction ID
5. Once complete, verify balance on destination chain: `get_balance`

### Example

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "to_chain": "ethereum",
  "token": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
  "amount": "100",
  "amount_units": "ui",
  "bridge_provider": "wormhole",
  "redeem": true
}
```

This bridges 100 USDC from Solana to Ethereum via Wormhole with auto-redeem enabled.

## Timing And Costs

Bridge times depend on source chain finality + bridge provider relay speed:

- **Solana → EVM:** Typically 5-20 minutes (Wormhole guardian consensus)
- **EVM → Solana:** Varies by EVM chain finality (Ethereum ~15 min, L2s faster)

Bridge fees are typically small but add to gas costs on both source and destination. Seashail handles gas on the source chain; destination chain gas is handled by the bridge relayer (or by Seashail if `redeem: true`).

## When to Bridge vs Swap

- **Bridge** when you want to move the same token (or its wrapped equivalent) to a different chain
- **Swap** when you want a different token on the same chain

You can combine: bridge USDC from Solana to Ethereum, then swap USDC to ETH.

## Notes

- For exact parameter details: [bridge_tokens reference](/docs/reference/tools-write#bridge_tokens)
- Bridge provider-specific parameters (Wormhole receiver address, LayerZero config) are documented in the reference
- `redeem: true` (default) requires the destination wallet to have gas for the redeem transaction
- `amount=max` is NOT supported for Wormhole native path
- Policy: Bridging must be enabled in your policy configuration (`enable_bridge` field)
