## Overview

Seashail's NFT tools cover three categories:

- **Inventory reads:** View NFTs you own
- **Direct transfers:** Send an NFT to another address
- **Marketplace trading:** Buy, sell, or bid on NFTs via transaction envelopes

Marketplace trading uses **transaction envelopes** — the agent (or a configured adapter) constructs marketplace-specific transactions, and Seashail signs them after policy evaluation.

Supported marketplaces: **Blur** (Ethereum), **Magic Eden** (Solana + cross-chain), **OpenSea** (Ethereum), **Tensor** (Solana).

## Viewing Your NFTs

Use `get_nft_inventory` to list NFT-like mints in your wallet:

- **Currently Solana only** (EVM inventory support may be added later)
- Returns mint addresses, metadata URIs, and collection info
- Specify `chain: "solana"` and optionally `limit` to cap results

Example:

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "limit": 100
}
```

This returns all NFT-like mints (tokens with amount = 1 and 0 decimals) owned by your active Solana address.

## Transferring NFTs

Use `transfer_nft` to send an NFT to another address:

- **Solana:** provide `chain: "solana"`, `to` (recipient address), and `mint` (SPL token mint)
- **EVM:** provide `chain` (e.g., "ethereum", "base"), `to`, `contract` (ERC-721 contract address), and `token_id`
- Policy evaluation applies — subject to `enable_nft` and `max_usd_per_nft_tx` policy controls
- Scam blocklist applies to both recipient and contract/mint addresses

### Solana transfers:

- Uses SPL token transfer (transfers exactly 1 token)
- Seashail creates the recipient's associated token account (ATA) if needed

### EVM transfers:

- Uses ERC-721 `safeTransferFrom`
- Token ID must be a decimal string (e.g., "1234")
- Transaction is simulated before broadcast

Example (Solana):

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "to": "11111111111111111111111111111111",
  "mint": "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112"
}
```

Example (EVM):

```json
{
  "chain": "base",
  "to": "0xRecipientAddress",
  "contract": "0xContractAddress",
  "token_id": "1234"
}
```

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how tiered approval works.

## Marketplace Trading

### How It Works

Marketplace operations (`buy_nft`, `sell_nft`, `bid_nft`) require **transaction envelopes**:

1. The agent (or adapter) fetches the marketplace listing/offer data
2. The agent constructs a transaction (or provides an `asset` object for a configured adapter to fetch it)
3. Seashail verifies it against policy, signs, and broadcasts

This design keeps marketplace-specific logic outside Seashail's security boundary while still enforcing policy controls.

### Buying NFTs

Use `buy_nft` to purchase a listed NFT:

- **Solana:** provide `tx_b64` (base64-encoded unsigned VersionedTransaction) and `allowed_program_ids` (allowlist of program IDs)
- **EVM:** provide `to` (contract address), `data` (calldata), and optionally `value_wei` (ETH value)
- Alternatively, provide `asset` object for marketplace adapter to fetch the envelope
- Policy evaluation applies (`enable_nft`, `max_usd_per_nft_tx`)
- Solana marketplace envelopes are **always force-confirmed** (user confirmation required regardless of policy tier)

Example (Solana, Magic Eden):

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "marketplace": "magic_eden",
  "usd_value": 50,
  "tx_b64": "BASE64...",
  "allowed_program_ids": [
    "ComputeBudget111111111111111111111111111111",
    "11111111111111111111111111111111"
  ]
}
```

Example (EVM, OpenSea):

```json
{
  "chain": "base",
  "marketplace": "opensea",
  "usd_value": 50,
  "to": "0x...",
  "data": "0x...",
  "value_wei": "0"
}
```

### Selling NFTs

Use `sell_nft` to list an NFT for sale or accept an offer:

- Same envelope format as `buy_nft` (see above)
- The agent constructs a sell/listing transaction for the chosen marketplace
- Use `get_nft_inventory` to discover which NFTs you own before selling

Example (Solana, Tensor):

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "marketplace": "tensor",
  "usd_value": 100,
  "tx_b64": "BASE64...",
  "allowed_program_ids": ["TCMPhJdwDryooaGGZjYoHRlM2vvDXcAP2BW2hhBKRmb"]
}
```

### Bidding On NFTs

Use `bid_nft` to place a bid or offer:

- Same envelope format as `buy_nft` (see above)
- The agent constructs a bid/offer transaction for the chosen marketplace
- Policy evaluation applies (same as buy/sell)

Example (EVM, Blur):

```json
{
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "marketplace": "blur",
  "usd_value": 25,
  "to": "0x...",
  "data": "0x...",
  "value_wei": "0"
}
```

## Marketplace Differences

### Blur (Ethereum)

- High-volume Ethereum marketplace
- Envelope: EVM transaction with `to`, `data`, `value_wei`
- Transaction is simulated before broadcast
- Scam blocklist applies to contract addresses

### Magic Eden (Solana + EVM)

- Cross-chain marketplace (Solana, Ethereum, Polygon, and more)
- Solana envelope: `tx_b64` with `allowed_program_ids`
- EVM envelope: `to`, `data`, `value_wei`
- Solana envelopes are force-confirmed (user confirmation required)

### OpenSea (Ethereum)

- Widely used Ethereum marketplace
- Envelope: EVM transaction with `to`, `data`, `value_wei`
- Supports Seaport protocol
- Transaction is simulated before broadcast

### Tensor (Solana)

- Solana-focused NFT marketplace
- Envelope: `tx_b64` with `allowed_program_ids`
- Solana envelopes are force-confirmed (user confirmation required)
- Known for compressed NFT support

## Typical Workflows

### Browse and buy:

1. Agent discovers listing on marketplace (off-chain)
2. Agent constructs envelope or provides `asset` object
3. `buy_nft` with the marketplace envelope
4. Confirm via MCP elicitation
5. `get_nft_inventory` to verify purchase

### Transfer to friend:

1. `get_nft_inventory` to find the NFT's mint (Solana) or contract + token_id (EVM)
2. `transfer_nft` with mint/contract+token_id and recipient address
3. Confirm if prompted

### List for sale:

1. `get_nft_inventory` to see what you own
2. Agent constructs sell/listing envelope
3. `sell_nft` with the marketplace envelope
4. Confirm via MCP elicitation

## Policy Controls

NFT trading is policy-gated:

- `enable_nft`: master toggle (default: `true`)
- `max_usd_per_nft_tx`: cap per-transaction USD value (default: `1000`)
- Transactions above the cap are blocked
- Transactions below the cap may be auto-approved or require confirmation depending on tiered approval settings

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how to configure policy.

## Notes

- For exact parameter details: [NFT Tools Reference](/docs/reference/tools-nfts)
- **Envelope duality:** the agent can supply the envelope directly, or a configured adapter can fetch it via the `asset` field
- **Solana marketplace envelopes are always force-confirmed** — user confirmation required regardless of policy tier
- Related: [Wallets Guide](/docs/guides/wallets) for managing wallet addresses
