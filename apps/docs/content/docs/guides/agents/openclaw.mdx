description: Connect Seashail to OpenClaw via MCP stdio.
---

OpenClaw can connect to Seashail via MCP stdio if your build supports it.

> Recommended: install the **Seashail OpenClaw plugin** for first-class native tools.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- An OpenClaw build with MCP support

## Setup (Recommended: OpenClaw Plugin)

If you already have OpenClaw installed, you can set everything up with one command:

```bash
seashail openclaw install
```

This installs the Seashail OpenClaw plugin and enables it in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

### Manual (OpenClaw CLI)

If you prefer OpenClaw’s CLI directly (for example on a machine that doesn’t have `seashail` on PATH yet):

```bash
openclaw plugins install @seashail/seashail
openclaw plugins enable seashail
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Setup (Fallback: Native MCP Support)

If your OpenClaw build supports MCP stdio servers directly, you can also configure an MCP server named `seashail` with:

- **Command:** `seashail`
- **Args:** `mcp`

## Setup (Bridge/Proxy)

If your OpenClaw build does not support MCP natively, use an MCP bridge tool that can run stdio MCP servers and proxy tool calls. Point the bridge at:

```bash
seashail mcp
```

If your bridge reads an `mcpServers` JSON file (often named `.mcp.json`), you can use the config shape in [Any MCP Client (Stdio)](/docs/guides/agents/any-mcp-client).

## Testnet Mode

- **Command:** `seashail`
- **Args:** `mcp --network testnet`

## Verification

After setup, ask OpenClaw to check your balance:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

OpenClaw should invoke the `get_balance` tool via Seashail.

## Troubleshooting

**MCP not supported**
Check if your OpenClaw build version supports MCP stdio. If not, use a bridge/proxy that can forward tool calls to a local stdio process.

**"seashail: command not found"**
Use the absolute path to the Seashail binary.
