description: Connect Seashail to Cline (VS Code extension) via MCP.
---

Cline supports MCP servers over stdio via its built-in UI. See the [Cline MCP docs](https://docs.cline.bot/mcp/configuring-mcp-servers) for full details.

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Configure Cline to run a local command (`seashail mcp`), not a “server URL”.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- Cline VS Code extension installed

## Setup

1. Open Cline in VS Code
2. Navigate to **MCP Servers** settings
3. Add a new server named `seashail`
4. Set:
   - **Command:** `seashail`
   - **Args:** `mcp`

## Testnet Mode

To connect to testnet, set the args to `mcp --network testnet`:

- **Command:** `seashail`
- **Args:** `mcp --network testnet`

## Alternative: Edit Config File Directly

Cline stores its MCP configuration in `cline_mcp_settings.json`. Access it via:
Cline panel > MCP Servers icon > Configure tab > Advanced MCP Settings.

The file is located at:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

Add Seashail to the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

After setup, start a Cline session and ask:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

Cline should discover and invoke Seashail tools via MCP.

## Troubleshooting

**Server doesn't connect**
Make sure `seashail` is on your `PATH`. Test by running `seashail mcp` in a terminal — you should see it start the MCP server.

**Cline doesn't detect MCP tools**
Restart VS Code after adding the MCP server in Cline's settings.
