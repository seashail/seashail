title: Any MCP Client (Stdio)
description: Connect Seashail to any MCP client using a stdio command (no SSE, no URL).

Seashail is **self-hosted** and **stdio-only**.

If your client UI asks for a “server URL” (SSE/HTTP), Seashail will not work with that mode. You must configure it as a **local command** the client launches.

## The Only Two Fields You Need

Most MCP clients ultimately ask for:

- **Command:** `seashail`
- **Args:** `mcp`

Testnet (optional):

- **Args:** `mcp --network testnet`

If `seashail` is not on your `PATH`, use an absolute path for **Command** instead (for example `/usr/local/bin/seashail`).

## Common Config File Shapes

If your MCP host uses an `mcpServers` JSON shape, this is the minimal config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your MCP host uses the VS Code `servers` JSON shape, this is the minimal config:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "seashail": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## “No Install” Option (Still Stdio)

If you want a one-liner that can run Seashail without placing `seashail` on your `PATH`, configure your MCP client to run via `npx`:

- **Command:** `npx`
- **Args:** `-y @seashail/mcp --`

Testnet (optional):

- **Args:** `-y @seashail/mcp -- --network testnet`

This still runs Seashail locally over stdio. (It may download the wrapper package the first time.)

If you prefer Python tooling, you can also run via `uvx`:

- **Command:** `uvx`
- **Args:** `seashail-mcp --`

Testnet (optional):

- **Args:** `seashail-mcp -- --network testnet`

## Verification

After configuring your client, ask:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

Your client should invoke Seashail’s `get_balance` tool.
