description: Connect Seashail to JetBrains IDEs via MCP.
---

JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm, etc.) support MCP servers via AI Assistant. See the [JetBrains MCP docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/mcp.html) for full details.

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Configure JetBrains to launch a local command (`seashail mcp`), not a server URL.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- A JetBrains IDE (2025.2+) with AI Assistant enabled

## Setup

1. Open **Settings | Tools | AI Assistant | Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
2. Click **Add** and select **STDIO**
3. Paste the following JSON config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click **OK**, then **Apply**

> If you already have Seashail configured in Claude Desktop, you can click **Import from Claude** to import it automatically.

## Testnet Mode

Use the same steps but change the args:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp", "--network", "testnet"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify

Ask your JetBrains AI agent:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

It should call Seashail's MCP tools.

## Troubleshooting

**MCP option not visible**
MCP support requires JetBrains IDE version 2025.2 or later and an active AI Assistant subscription.

**"seashail: command not found"**
Use the absolute path to the binary (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/seashail`) in the config.
