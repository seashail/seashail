description: Connect Seashail to VS Code and GitHub Copilot via MCP config.
---

VS Code reads MCP server configuration from `.vscode/mcp.json` in a workspace.

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Configure VS Code to run a local command (`seashail mcp`), not a “server URL”.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension installed

## Setup (Recommended)

Use the one-click installer:

```bash
seashail agent install vscode
```

This creates `.vscode/mcp.json` in your current workspace.

## Manual Setup

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "seashail": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: VS Code uses `"servers"` with a `"type"` field, unlike Cursor and Claude Desktop which use `"mcpServers"`.

## “No Install” Option (npx)

If you don’t want to install `seashail` onto your `PATH`, you can run via `npx`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "seashail": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@seashail/mcp", "--"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testnet Mode

```bash
seashail agent install vscode --network testnet
```

Or manually set args to `["mcp", "--network", "testnet"]`.

## Verification

After setup, open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code and ask:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

Copilot should discover and invoke Seashail tools via MCP.

## Troubleshooting

**MCP server not detected**
Ensure the `.vscode/mcp.json` file is in the workspace root that VS Code has open. Reload the window after adding the config.

**Copilot doesn't use MCP tools**
MCP tool support in GitHub Copilot requires a compatible extension version. Make sure your Copilot extension is up to date.
