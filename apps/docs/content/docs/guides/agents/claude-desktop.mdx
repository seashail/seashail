description: Connect Seashail to Claude Desktop via MCP config.
---

Claude Desktop reads MCP server configuration from a JSON config file.

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Claude Desktop should be configured to launch `seashail mcp` as a local command.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- Claude Desktop installed

## Setup (Recommended)

Use the one-click installer:

```bash
seashail agent install claude-desktop
```

This writes the config to the correct location for your OS.

## Manual Setup

The config file location depends on your OS:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following to the file (create it if it doesn't exist):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## “No Install” Option (npx)

If you don’t want to install `seashail` onto your `PATH`, you can configure Claude Desktop to run via `npx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@seashail/mcp", "--"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testnet Mode

```bash
seashail agent install claude-desktop --network testnet
```

Or manually change args to `["mcp", "--network", "testnet"]`.

## Verification

Restart Claude Desktop after config changes. Start a conversation and ask:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

You should see Seashail tools listed in the available tools panel.

## Troubleshooting

**Tools not appearing**
Restart Claude Desktop completely after editing the config file.

**"seashail: command not found"**
Use the absolute path to the binary in the config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```
