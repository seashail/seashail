description: Connect Seashail to Claude Code via MCP stdio.
---

Claude Code supports MCP servers natively via the `claude` CLI. See the [Claude Code MCP docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) for full details.

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Claude Code launches `seashail mcp` as a local command over stdio.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- Claude Code installed

## Setup

Add Seashail as an MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add seashail -- seashail mcp
```

This registers an MCP server named `seashail` that launches the Seashail binary over stdio.

## Testnet Mode

To connect to testnet instead of mainnet:

```bash
claude mcp add seashail-testnet -- seashail mcp --network testnet
```

You can have both `seashail` (mainnet) and `seashail-testnet` registered simultaneously and switch between them per session.

## Verification

After setup, start a Claude Code session and ask it to check your balance:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

Claude Code should invoke the `get_balance` tool via Seashail and return your wallet balance.

## Troubleshooting

**"seashail: command not found"**
If your Seashail install isn't on `PATH`, use the absolute path:

```bash
claude mcp add seashail -- /path/to/seashail mcp
```

**MCP server doesn't respond**
Make sure the Seashail daemon isn't blocked by a firewall or permission issue. Run `seashail mcp` manually in a terminal to check for errors.

**Remove and re-add**

```bash
claude mcp remove seashail
claude mcp add seashail -- seashail mcp
```
