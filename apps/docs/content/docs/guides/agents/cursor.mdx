description: Connect Seashail to Cursor via MCP config.
---

Cursor reads MCP server configuration from `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-level) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global).

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Configure Cursor to run a local command (`seashail mcp`), not a “server URL”.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- Cursor installed

## Setup (Recommended)

Use the one-click installer for project-level config:

```bash
seashail agent install cursor
```

This creates `.cursor/mcp.json` in your current workspace.

## Manual Setup

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root (or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## “No Install” Option (npx)

If you don’t want to install `seashail` onto your `PATH`, you can run via `npx`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@seashail/mcp", "--"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testnet Mode

```bash
seashail agent install cursor --network testnet
```

Or manually set args to `["mcp", "--network", "testnet"]`.

## Verification

After setup, open a Cursor chat and ask:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

Cursor should discover and use Seashail's MCP tools automatically.

## Troubleshooting

**MCP server not detected**
Make sure the config file is in the right location. For workspace-local config, it must be at `.cursor/mcp.json` relative to the project root you opened in Cursor.

**Global vs. local**
Global config (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`) applies to all projects. Local config (`.cursor/mcp.json` in the project) overrides global for that workspace.
