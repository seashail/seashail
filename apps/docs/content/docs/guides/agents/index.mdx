title: Connect Your Agent
description: Configure MCP stdio so your agent can use Seashail tools.
---

Seashail exposes an MCP server over stdio. Any MCP-capable agent can connect and trade.

```bash
seashail mcp
```

> Seashail is **stdio-only** (self-hosted). If your agent UI asks for a “server URL” (SSE/HTTP), configure a **local command** instead. See: [Any MCP Client (Stdio)](/docs/guides/agents/any-mcp-client).

Override network mode for a session:

```bash
seashail mcp --network testnet
```

## One-Click Templates

Seashail ships config templates for common clients. List supported targets:

```bash
seashail agent list
```

Install a template (workspace-local or global, depending on the agent):

```bash
seashail agent install cursor
seashail agent install vscode
seashail agent install windsurf
seashail agent install claude-desktop
```

Some clients (for example Continue and JetBrains) require manual configuration; see their pages for copy-paste templates.

Testnet templates:

```bash
seashail agent install cursor --network testnet
```

## Multi-Client Behavior

MCP is stdio-based, so each agent launches its own `seashail mcp` process.

Seashail avoids split-brain keys and state by using a **singleton local daemon**:

- `seashail mcp` runs as a thin stdio proxy
- It forwards all requests to `seashail daemon`, which owns the keystore and passphrase session
- If no daemon is running, `seashail mcp` autostarts it

Multiple agents can safely share:

- The same wallets and keystore
- The same in-memory passphrase session
- The same policy counters (daily caps, etc.)

Local transport is IPC-only:

- macOS/Linux: Unix socket at `data_dir/seashail-mcp.sock`
- Windows: named pipe (no TCP listener)

> **Debug mode:** `seashail mcp --standalone` runs a direct stdio server without the daemon, useful for debugging but does not share state across clients.

## Other Agents (Generic MCP Stdio)

If your agent isn’t listed above, you can still connect as long as it supports **MCP over stdio** (launching a local command).

1. Install Seashail (recommended): follow [Install Seashail](/docs/getting-started/install) so `seashail` is on your `PATH`.
2. Configure your agent to run: Command: `seashail` and Args: `mcp`.

Testnet (optional):

- Args: `mcp --network testnet`

If your agent uses a JSON config file (often named `.mcp.json`), these are the two common shapes:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": { "command": "seashail", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "seashail": { "type": "stdio", "command": "seashail", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

“No install” option (still stdio):

- Command: `npx`
- Args: `-y @seashail/mcp --`

Verify by asking your agent:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```
