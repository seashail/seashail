description: Connect Seashail to OpenAI Codex via MCP.
---

[Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/) supports MCP servers via its TOML configuration file. See the [Codex MCP docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp) for full details.

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Codex must be configured to run a local command (`seashail mcp`), not connect to a server URL.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- Codex CLI installed ([install guide](https://github.com/openai/codex#readme))

## Setup

Add the following to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.seashail]
command = "seashail"
args = ["mcp"]
```

## Testnet Mode

```toml
[mcp_servers.seashail-testnet]
command = "seashail"
args = ["mcp", "--network", "testnet"]
```

You can have both `seashail` and `seashail-testnet` in your config and Codex will connect to both.

## Verification

After setup, start a Codex session and ask:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

Codex should invoke the `get_balance` tool via Seashail.

## Troubleshooting

**"seashail: command not found"**
Use the absolute path to the binary in the config:

```toml
[mcp_servers.seashail]
command = "/usr/local/bin/seashail"
args = ["mcp"]
```

**MCP tools not available**
Ensure your Codex version supports MCP servers. Check the [Codex changelog](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases) for MCP support status.
