description: Connect Seashail to Continue via MCP.
---

[Continue](https://www.continue.dev) supports MCP servers over stdio. See the [Continue MCP docs](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/mcp) for full details.

> Seashail is **stdio-only**. Configure Continue to launch a local command (`seashail mcp`), not a server URL.

## Prerequisites

- [Seashail installed](/docs/getting-started/install) and on your `PATH`
- A wallet created (`seashail wallet create`)
- Continue extension installed

## Setup (Option 1: Standalone File)

Create `.continue/mcpServers/seashail.yaml` in your project:

```yaml
name: Seashail
version: 0.0.1
schema: v1
mcpServers:
  - name: seashail
    command: seashail
    args:
      - mcp
```

## Setup (Option 2: config.yaml)

Add to your `.continue/config.yaml`:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: seashail
    command: seashail
    args:
      - mcp
```

## Setup (Option 3: JSON File)

Continue also reads JSON files dropped into `.continue/mcpServers/`. Create `.continue/mcpServers/seashail.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "seashail": {
      "command": "seashail",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Testnet Mode

For YAML, change args to:

```yaml
args:
  - mcp
  - "--network"
  - testnet
```

For JSON, change args to `["mcp", "--network", "testnet"]`.

## Verify

Ask Continue:

```
What's my SOL balance?
```

It should call Seashail's MCP tools.
