title: Scam Blocklist
description: Optional signed scam-address blocklist.
---

Seashail can optionally fetch a **signed scam-address blocklist** and block writes to listed recipients/contracts.

This is designed to catch obvious mistakes (and known-bad destinations), not to make trading "safe" by itself.

Seashail does **not** ship a default blocklist. This feature is **opt-in**: you must configure a URL (and ideally pin the expected signing key) in `config.toml`.

## Availability Model

The blocklist is a defense-in-depth _filter_, not a consensus rule.

- If blocklist fetch/verification fails and no valid cache is available, Seashail continues without blocklist protection (fail-open).
- Once a valid cache exists, Seashail will use it until it can refresh successfully.

## What Gets Blocked

When enabled, Seashail will refuse to sign/broadcast writes where the recipient (and in some cases the relevant contract) is listed:

- `send_transaction`: blocks sends to listed recipients
- `transfer_nft`: blocks transfers to listed recipients (and blocks listed NFT contracts/mints)
- `buy_nft` / `sell_nft` / `bid_nft`: blocks if the tx recipient/contract is listed

## Config

In `config.toml`:

```toml
[http]
# Must be https:// (or http://localhost for local testing)
scam_blocklist_url = "https://example.com/seashail/scam-blocklist.json"

# Recommended: pin the expected Ed25519 verifying key (base64, 32 bytes).
# If omitted, Seashail will use the pubkey embedded in the fetched envelope.
scam_blocklist_pubkey_b64 = "..."

# How often to refresh the blocklist.
scam_blocklist_refresh_seconds = 21600
```

## Signed Envelope Format

The fetched JSON must be an envelope:

- `version`: currently `1`
- `payload_b64`: base64-encoded JSON payload bytes
- `signature_b64`: base64 Ed25519 signature over the payload bytes
- `pubkey_b64`: base64 Ed25519 verifying key (32 bytes)

The decoded payload JSON has:

- `evm`: list of 0x-prefixed addresses
- `solana`: list of base58 pubkeys

## Operational Guidance

- Prefer pinning `scam_blocklist_pubkey_b64` so the trust anchor is in local config.
- Host the envelope somewhere stable and cacheable.
- Treat blocklisting as a defense-in-depth layer. Policy caps, allowlists, simulation, and confirmations still matter.
