## What Are Perpetual Futures

Perpetual futures (perps) are leveraged derivatives that track an asset's price without an expiration date:

- You can go **long** (profit when price rises) or **short** (profit when price falls)
- Leverage amplifies both gains and losses — a 10x leveraged position loses 10% of its collateral for every 1% price drop
- Unlike traditional futures, perps have no expiration; they stay open until you close them or get liquidated
- Seashail supports two perps venues: **Hyperliquid** (EVM address) and **Jupiter Perps** (Solana address)

## Venue Differences

### Hyperliquid

- Uses your wallet's **EVM address** (Arbitrum-bridged, but Hyperliquid runs its own L1)
- Supports both mainnet and testnet
- Wide range of markets: BTC, ETH, SOL, and many alt-perps
- Default venue when `provider` parameter is omitted
- Supports both market and limit orders
- Supports partial position closures

### Jupiter Perps

- Uses your wallet's **Solana address**
- Mainnet only (no testnet support)
- SOL-focused markets
- Set `provider: "jupiter_perps"` explicitly
- Market orders only
- Full position closure only

## Opening A Position

Use `open_perp_position` to enter a leveraged position:

- **Required parameters:** `market` (e.g., "BTC"), `side` ("long" or "short"), `size`, `leverage`
- Policy evaluation applies: `max_leverage` and `max_usd_per_position` are enforced
- Leverage is subject to your policy limit — the tool will reject if requested leverage exceeds `max_leverage`
- If your policy requires confirmation for the transaction value, you'll get an MCP elicitation prompt

### Typical workflow:

1. Check available markets: `get_market_data`
2. Open position: `open_perp_position`
3. Confirm via MCP elicitation if policy requires it
4. Verify position opened: `get_positions`

Example (Hyperliquid, long BTC at 3x leverage):

```json
{
  "provider": "hyperliquid",
  "market": "BTC",
  "side": "long",
  "size": "100",
  "size_units": "usd",
  "leverage": 3,
  "order_type": "market"
}
```

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how tiered approval works.

## Managing Positions

### Viewing Positions

Use `get_positions` to see all open positions:

- Returns market, side (long/short), size, entry price, current mark price
- Shows unrealized PnL (profit and loss)
- Works on both Hyperliquid and Jupiter Perps

### Closing Positions

Use `close_perp_position` to exit a position:

- **Hyperliquid:** supports full close (omit `size`) or partial close (provide `size`)
- **Jupiter Perps:** supports full close only
- Policy evaluation applies (same as opening)

Example (close entire BTC position on Hyperliquid):

```json
{
  "provider": "hyperliquid",
  "market": "BTC"
}
```

### Limit Orders

Use `place_limit_order` to place orders that execute when price hits a target:

- **Hyperliquid only** (Jupiter Perps does not support limit orders)
- Specify `market`, `side`, `size`, `leverage`, and `limit_px`
- Useful for entering positions at specific price levels

### Modifying Orders

Use `modify_perp_order` to change existing limit orders:

- **Hyperliquid only**
- Implemented as cancel + new order
- Change price, size, or leverage

## Risk Considerations

### Liquidation

If your position's losses approach your collateral, the venue will liquidate it:

- Higher leverage = liquidation price is closer to entry price
- A 10x long position gets liquidated if price drops ~10%
- A 10x short position gets liquidated if price rises ~10%
- Liquidation may result in total loss of collateral for that position

### Funding Rates

Perps charge periodic funding fees to keep perpetual contract prices anchored to spot:

- When the market is bullish (perp > spot), **long positions pay** funding to short positions
- When the market is bearish (perp < spot), **short positions pay** funding to long positions
- Funding rates are displayed in `get_market_data` and typically charged every 8 hours
- Persistent funding costs can erode profits over time

### Venue Risk

Each venue has its own risk profile:

- **Hyperliquid:** Newer venue with its own L1; smart contract and oracle risk
- **Jupiter Perps:** Relies on Solana's oracle infrastructure and program security
- Both are decentralized venues but carry smart contract and oracle failure risk
- Consider splitting large positions across venues for diversification

### Policy Controls

Configure perps-specific policy controls to limit exposure:

- `enable_perps`: master toggle (default: `true`)
- `max_leverage`: cap leverage multiplier (default: `10`)
- `max_usd_per_position`: cap position size (default: `1000`)
- Set lower limits if you want additional safeguards

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how to configure policy.

## Notes

- For exact parameter details: [Perps Tools Reference](/docs/reference/tools-perps)
- Read `get_market_data` before trading to see available markets, current prices, and funding rates
- Related: [Swapping Guide](/docs/guides/swapping) for spot token exchanges (non-leveraged)
- Perps trading is high-risk; only trade with capital you can afford to lose
