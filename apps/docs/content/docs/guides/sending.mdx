title: Sending Tokens
description: Transfer native tokens and fungible tokens across Solana and EVM chains.

## How Sending Works

`send_transaction` transfers native tokens (SOL, ETH, etc.) or fungible tokens (SPL, ERC-20):

- Seashail handles chain-specific mechanics: ATA creation on Solana, ERC-20 approval on EVM
- All sends go through policy evaluation — subject to tiered approval, allowlists, and daily caps
- Address validation happens before signing

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how policy controls work.

## Per-Chain Behavior

### Solana

- Supports native SOL and SPL tokens
- Seashail auto-creates the recipient's Associated Token Account (ATA) if it doesn't exist
- Token identifier: SPL mint pubkey or `"native"`

### EVM Chains

- Supports native ETH/MATIC/BNB/AVAX/etc. and ERC-20 tokens
- Token identifier: ERC-20 contract address or `"native"`
- Scam-address blocklist may block recipients when configured

See [Chains and Funding](/docs/guides/chains-and-funding) for chain identifiers.

## Address Validation

Seashail validates address format before signing:

- **Solana:** base58-encoded public key (32 bytes)
- **EVM:** `0x`-prefixed hex address (20 bytes)
- The scam blocklist (if configured) will reject known scam addresses on EVM chains

## Amount Formats

Amount formatting works the same as swapping:

- `amount` is a decimal string (for example, `"0.5"`, `"100"`)
- `amount_units` defaults to `"ui"` (human-readable token units)
- For token sends, `"ui"` uses the token's native decimal precision (for example, 6 decimals for USDC)
- `"base"` uses raw units (lamports for SOL, wei for ETH)

## Typical Workflow

1. Check your balance: `get_balance` or `get_portfolio`
2. Send: `send_transaction` with `chain`, `to`, `token`, `amount`
3. Confirm policy approval if prompted (via MCP elicitation)
4. Verify: `get_balance` or `get_transaction_history`

Example send (Solana, native SOL):

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "to": "RecipientPublicKey...",
  "token": "native",
  "amount": "0.5",
  "amount_units": "ui"
}
```

## When to Send vs Swap vs Bridge

- **Send** when you want to transfer tokens you already hold to another address on the same chain
- **Swap** when you want to exchange one token for another on the same chain
- **Bridge** when you want to move tokens to a different chain

You can combine: bridge → swap → send.

## Notes

- Sends of unknown-USD-value tokens may be blocked if `deny_unknown_usd_value` is enabled in policy
- For exact parameter details: [send_transaction reference](/docs/reference/tools-write#send_transaction)
