## What Are Prediction Markets

Prediction markets let you bet on the outcome of real-world events: elections, sports results, crypto milestones, and more. You're not just speculating — you're trading outcome shares that represent the market's collective belief about what will happen.

Seashail integrates with Polymarket, the largest prediction market platform, which operates on Polygon using a CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) model.

How it works:

- Each event has 2 or more possible outcomes (for example, "Yes" and "No")
- Each outcome has shares priced between $0.00 and $1.00
- A "Yes" share at $0.60 means the market prices the event at 60% probability
- If the event resolves in your favor, your shares pay out $1.00 each
- If it resolves against you, your shares are worth $0.00

## How Polymarket Works

Polymarket uses a CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) — the same order matching system used by traditional stock exchanges. This is different from automated market makers (AMMs) used by most DeFi protocols.

Key concepts:

- You place limit orders at a specific price (for example, "buy 100 shares at $0.55")
- Orders sit in the orderbook until a counterparty matches them
- You can view the orderbook depth to see current bids and asks
- Each outcome has a unique `token_id` — this is what you use when placing orders

All Polymarket trading happens on Polygon (EVM). You need:

- A Polygon wallet address
- USDC on Polygon for trading (bridge or swap to get USDC on Polygon)

See [Bridging Guide](/docs/guides/bridging) for moving USDC to Polygon.

## Finding Markets

Seashail provides two tools for market discovery:

### Searching Markets

Use `search_prediction_markets` to search for events by keyword:

```json
{
  "query": "Bitcoin 100k",
  "limit": 10,
  "include_closed": false
}
```

The response includes:

- Event titles and market questions
- Outcomes with their `token_id` values
- Current prices for each outcome
- Market status (open/closed)

### Viewing Orderbooks

Use `get_prediction_orderbook` with a `token_id` to see current bids and asks:

```json
{
  "token_id": "1234567890"
}
```

The response shows:

- Current bid and ask prices
- Size (liquidity) at each price level
- Mid-price

This helps you understand market depth before placing an order.

Both tools are read-only — no policy approval needed.

## Placing Predictions

Use `place_prediction` to place a CLOB order on Polymarket.

Required parameters:

- `token_id` — the outcome token ID (from search results)
- `side` — "buy" or "sell"
- `chain` — "polygon" (or "polygon-amoy" for testing)

Order types:

### Limit Orders (default)

Specify exact price and size:

```json
{
  "chain": "polygon",
  "token_id": "1234567890",
  "side": "buy",
  "order_kind": "limit",
  "price": "0.55",
  "size": "100",
  "time_in_force": "gtc"
}
```

This places a limit buy order for 100 shares at $0.55 per share, good-til-canceled (GTC).

Time-in-force options:

- `gtc` — good-til-canceled (default)
- `gtd` — good-til-date
- `fok` — fill-or-kill (execute completely or cancel)
- `fak` — fill-and-kill (execute what's possible, cancel remainder)

### Market Orders

Execute immediately at current market price:

```json
{
  "chain": "polygon",
  "token_id": "1234567890",
  "side": "buy",
  "order_kind": "market",
  "amount_usdc": "50"
}
```

This buys $50 USDC worth of shares at the current best available price.

### Policy Approval

Prediction orders are subject to policy evaluation:

- Treated as write operations (same as swaps or sends)
- Transaction value checked against `max_usd_per_tx` and daily caps
- Tiered approval applies (may be auto-approved, require confirmation, or be blocked)

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how tiered approval works.

### Typical Workflow

1. Search markets: `search_prediction_markets`
2. Check orderbook depth: `get_prediction_orderbook`
3. Place order: `place_prediction`
4. Confirm if prompted (via MCP elicitation)
5. Check positions: `get_prediction_positions`

## Closing Positions

Use `close_prediction` to cancel an existing CLOB order:

```json
{
  "chain": "polygon",
  "order_id": "0xabcdef123456"
}
```

The `order_id` is returned when you place an order with `place_prediction`.

Note: This cancels an open order. To sell outcome shares you already hold, use `place_prediction` with `side: "sell"`.

## Tracking Positions

Use `get_prediction_positions` to see all your open prediction positions:

```json
{
  "chain": "polygon"
}
```

The response shows:

- Market title and outcome
- Number of shares held
- Average entry price
- Current market price
- Unrealized profit/loss in USD

This is a read-only operation using the Polymarket Data API (no key required).

## Risk Considerations

### Binary Outcomes

Prediction markets are binary: if the event resolves against you, you lose your entire position. Unlike traditional trading where you might lose a percentage, prediction markets can result in 100% loss.

### Illiquidity

Some markets have thin orderbooks. Large orders may not fill completely, or may move the price significantly. Always check orderbook depth before placing large orders.

### Resolution Disputes

Event resolution depends on oracle data. Disputed resolutions can delay payouts or (rarely) result in market invalidation. Resolution rules vary by market.

### USDC Exposure

All Polymarket trading is denominated in USDC on Polygon. You're exposed to:

- USDC depeg risk (stablecoin risk)
- Polygon network risk
- Bridge risk when moving USDC to Polygon

### Policy Safeguards

Use policy controls to limit exposure:

- Set conservative `max_usd_per_tx` limits for predictions
- Use `max_usd_per_day` to cap daily prediction spending
- Monitor positions regularly with `get_prediction_positions`

## Notes

- For exact parameter details: [Prediction Market Tools Reference](/docs/reference/tools-predictions)
- Trading requires USDC on Polygon — bridge or swap to get USDC on Polygon first
- Related: [Bridging Guide](/docs/guides/bridging) for moving USDC to Polygon
- Polymarket CLOB requires HTTPS or localhost (enforced by Polymarket API)
- The Polymarket Gamma API (market search) and Data API (positions) are keyless
- Order placement and cancellation use the Polymarket CLOB API (signed locally)
