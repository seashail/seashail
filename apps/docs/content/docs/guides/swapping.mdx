title: Swapping Tokens
description: Swap tokens across chains using Jupiter (Solana) and Uniswap or 1inch (EVM).

## How Swapping Works

Seashail's `swap_tokens` tool handles routing automatically:

- On Solana: routes through Jupiter aggregator
- On EVM chains: routes through Uniswap by default; 1inch available when configured
- Policy evaluation happens before signing — swaps are subject to the same tiered approval as any write operation

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for how tiered approval works.

## Choosing Your Chain

Swaps are chain-specific: you must specify which chain the swap executes on.

- Solana swaps use Jupiter (best-route aggregation across Raydium, Orca, etc.)
- EVM swaps default to Uniswap; 1inch is available on chains where configured (check `get_capabilities`)
- Cross-chain swaps are NOT supported by `swap_tokens` — use `bridge_tokens` first, then swap on the destination chain

See [Chains and Funding](/docs/guides/chains-and-funding) for supported chains.

## Token Identifiers

Token identifier format varies by chain:

- **Solana:** use the SPL mint pubkey (for example, `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` for USDC)
- **EVM:** use the ERC-20 contract address (for example, `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48` for USDC on Ethereum)
- **Native tokens:** use `"native"` for SOL, ETH, MATIC, etc.

Use `inspect_token` to look up token details, or `get_balance` / `get_portfolio` to see what you hold.

## Slippage

Slippage tolerance controls how much price movement you'll tolerate during a swap:

- Default slippage tolerance is set in your policy (`max_slippage_bps`)
- You can override per-swap with the `slippage_bps` parameter (basis points: 100 bps = 1%)
- If actual slippage exceeds the limit, the swap is rejected before signing
- For volatile tokens or low-liquidity pairs, you may need higher slippage

See [Policy and Approvals](/docs/guides/policy-and-approvals) for default slippage configuration.

## Amount Formats

The `amount` and `amount_units` parameters control how amounts are interpreted:

- `amount` is a decimal string (for example, `"10"`, `"0.5"`)
- `amount_units`: `"ui"` (default) for human-readable amounts, `"base"` for raw units (lamports, wei)

Use `"ui"` unless you have a specific reason to use base units.

## Typical Workflow

1. Check your balance: `get_balance` or `get_portfolio`
2. (Optional) Look up a token: `inspect_token`
3. Swap: `swap_tokens` with `chain`, `token_in`, `token_out`, `amount_in`
4. Confirm policy approval if prompted (via MCP elicitation)
5. Verify the swap landed: `get_balance` or `get_portfolio`

Example swap (Solana, SOL → USDC):

```json
{
  "chain": "solana",
  "token_in": "native",
  "token_out": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
  "amount_in": "1",
  "amount_units": "ui"
}
```

## Notes

- Routing is automatic — Seashail picks the best route via Jupiter (Solana) or Uniswap (EVM)
- For exact parameter details: [swap_tokens reference](/docs/reference/tools-write#swap_tokens)
- Related: [Bridging Guide](/docs/guides/bridging) for cross-chain transfers before swapping
