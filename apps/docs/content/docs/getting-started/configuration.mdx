## Paths

Print resolved paths:

```bash
seashail paths
```

Environment overrides (useful for tests/CI):

- `SEASHAIL_CONFIG_DIR`
- `SEASHAIL_DATA_DIR`

For all CLI commands and flags, see the [CLI reference](../reference/cli).

## Config File

`config.toml` lives under `config_dir`. For policy-specific configuration (spending limits, allowlists, approval thresholds), use MCP tools rather than editing TOML directly. See the [Policy Tools Reference](../reference/tools-policy).

Example `config.toml`:

```toml
network_mode = "mainnet" # or "testnet"

[rpc]
solana_rpc_url = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"

[http]
binance_base_url = "https://api.binance.com"
jupiter_base_url = "https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1"
# 1inch requires an API key. If unset, swaps use the Uniswap provider on EVM.
# oneinch_api_key = "..."

# Hyperliquid (perps)
hyperliquid_base_url_mainnet = "https://api.hyperliquid.xyz"
hyperliquid_base_url_testnet = "https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz"

# Scam address blocklist (optional, security-relevant)
# For threat analysis of scam address blocking, see the security model guide.
# scam_blocklist_url = "https://example.com/seashail/scam-blocklist.json"
# scam_blocklist_pubkey_b64 = "..." # 32-byte Ed25519 verifying key (base64)
# scam_blocklist_refresh_seconds = 21600

# NFT marketplace adapter endpoints (optional)
# These are *tx-envelope construction* endpoints. Seashail will fetch an envelope and still
# enforce policy + allowlists, force confirmation, and simulate before broadcast.
# blur_adapter_base_url = "https://example.com/adapters/blur"
# magic_eden_adapter_base_url = "https://example.com/adapters/magic-eden"
# opensea_adapter_base_url = "https://example.com/adapters/opensea"
# opensea_api_key = "..." # required for OpenSea adapters in most setups
# tensor_adapter_base_url = "https://example.com/adapters/tensor"
```

## Network Mode (Mainnet/Testnet)

Mainnet is the default.

Network mode is a convenience setting that affects default chain selection when tools omit `chain`/`chains`.
It does not hard-block mainnet/testnet usage: if a tool explicitly specifies a chain (for example `chain="ethereum"`),
Seashail will use that chain regardless of the current mode.

For a deeper explanation (including Solana RPC defaults, airdrops, and faucets), see:

- `/docs/guides/network-mode`

### First Run Defaults (Zero-Config)

If you want zero-config defaults for testnets, set this environment variable before first run (before `config.toml` is created):

```bash
export SEASHAIL_NETWORK_MODE=testnet
```

Alias:

```bash
export SEASHAIL_NETWORK=testnet
```

Legacy compatibility (not recommended):

```bash
export SEASHAIL_TESTNET_MODE=1
```

### Per-Client Override (Non-Persistent)

Per-client override (does not modify `config.toml`):

```bash
seashail mcp --network testnet
```

### Persistent Configuration

You can also set the mode in `config.toml`:

```toml
network_mode = "testnet"
```

Agents can persist the mode via MCP using `set_network_mode`.
