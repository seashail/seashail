## 1. Install Seashail

macOS / Linux (installer, source build):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://seashail.com/install | sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://seashail.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

## 2. Set Up Your Agent

Your agent starts Seashail automatically — you just need to tell it how. Pick your agent:

**OpenClaw** ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/plugin)):

```bash
seashail openclaw install
```

**Claude Code** ([docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp)):

```bash
claude mcp add seashail -- seashail mcp
```

**Claude Desktop** ([docs](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/10949351-getting-started-with-local-mcp-servers-on-claude-desktop)):

```bash
seashail agent install claude-desktop
```

**Codex** ([docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp)):

Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.seashail]
command = "seashail"
args = ["mcp"]
```

**Cursor** ([docs](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)):

```bash
seashail agent install cursor
```

**VS Code / GitHub Copilot** ([docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers)):

```bash
seashail agent install vscode
```

**Windsurf** ([docs](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp)):

```bash
seashail agent install windsurf
```

For all other agents (Cline, Continue, JetBrains, and any MCP client), see [Connect Your Agent](../guides/agents).

> **Testnet mode:** Add `--network testnet` to any of the above. For example: `seashail agent install cursor --network testnet` or `claude mcp add seashail-testnet -- seashail mcp --network testnet`.

## 3. First Run

On first connection, Seashail automatically creates a default wallet so your agent can immediately query addresses and balances — no prompts required. This wallet is encrypted with a machine-local secret, meaning it is tied to the device it was created on.

To create an additional wallet with stronger recovery options, ask your agent to call the `create_wallet` tool. This uses MCP elicitation to:

- set a passphrase (min 8 characters, stored nowhere)
- show and confirm an offline backup share (Shamir 2-of-3)
- accept disclaimers

Key material never leaves the Seashail process. The agent only receives tool outputs (balances, quotes, tx hashes, etc.). For security details, see the [security model](../guides/security-model).

**Key terms:**

- **Elicitation:** MCP protocol for user prompts (passphrases, confirmations) without sending data to agent. See [Glossary](../glossary).
- **Passphrase session:** Time-limited (default 1 hour) unlocked state after setting a passphrase. Re-authentication required after expiry.
