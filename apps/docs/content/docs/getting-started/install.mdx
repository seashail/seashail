## Recommended: Install The `seashail` Binary

Seashail is a local binary. Your agent runs it as an MCP stdio server (via `seashail mcp`).

You need:

- `git`
- `cargo` (Rust toolchain)

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://seashail.com/install | sh
```

If `seashail` is not found after install, add the default install dir to your shell `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

If you have WSL, you can run the macOS/Linux installer inside WSL.

Otherwise, install with PowerShell (source build):

```powershell
irm https://seashail.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

If `seashail` is not found after install, add the default install dir to your `PATH` for the current session:

```powershell
$env:Path = "$HOME\.local\bin;$env:Path"
```

## No-Install Options

If you don't want to install the `seashail` binary, you can reference these wrappers in your agent's MCP config instead. They install and run Seashail automatically.

### npx (Node.js)

Use this as your MCP server command:

- **Command:** `npx`
- **Args:** `-y @seashail/mcp --`

Testnet:

- **Args:** `-y @seashail/mcp -- --network testnet`

### uvx (Python)

Use this as your MCP server command:

- **Command:** `uvx`
- **Args:** `seashail-mcp`

Testnet:

- **Args:** `seashail-mcp -- --network testnet`

> These wrappers call `seashail mcp` under the hood. If `seashail` is already installed, they will use it; otherwise they run the hosted installer (source build).

## OpenClaw Users

If you use [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), install Seashail as a native plugin:

```bash
seashail openclaw install
```

Or via the OpenClaw CLI directly:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @seashail/seashail
openclaw plugins enable seashail
openclaw gateway restart
```

See the [OpenClaw setup guide](../guides/agents/openclaw) for full details.

## Verify Installation

After installing, verify the binary is working correctly:

```bash
seashail doctor
```

This checks for common issues (missing dependencies, permissions, path configuration). For detailed diagnostics, see the [CLI reference](../reference/cli#doctor).

## Build From Source (Dev)

If you are hacking on the repo:

```bash
bun install
bun run check

cargo build -p seashail
```

The binary will be at:

```bash
./target/debug/seashail
```

To use the dev binary with your agent, point your agent config to:

- **Command:** `./target/debug/seashail`
- **Args:** `mcp`

You can also print the resolved config and data paths:

```bash
./target/debug/seashail paths
```

## Next Steps

- [Connect Your Agent](../guides/agents) — Set up Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, OpenClaw, and more
- [Quickstart](./quickstart) — Create your first wallet and start trading
- [Configuration](./configuration) — Customize paths, network mode, and RPC endpoints

## Notes

- Seashail is non-custodial: if you lose your passphrase and/or recovery share(s), funds can be permanently unrecoverable.
- Transactions are irreversible.
