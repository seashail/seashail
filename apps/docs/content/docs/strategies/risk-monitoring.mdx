title: "Recipe: Risk Monitoring"
description: Monitor portfolio health, open positions, and liquidation risk across protocols
---

## Overview

Establish a risk monitoring routine by checking portfolio P&L, position health across lending/perps/predictions, and identifying liquidation risks before they materialize.

**Tools used:** `get_portfolio`, `get_portfolio_analytics`, `get_positions`, `get_lending_positions`, `get_prediction_positions`
**Chains:** All supported chains
**Time to complete:** 5-10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Active wallet(s) with positions deployed across protocols
- Understanding of health factor (lending) and liquidation price (perps)

<Steps>

### Step 1: Get portfolio overview

Fetch portfolio totals with historical P&L tracking.

```json
{
  "name": "get_portfolio",
  "arguments": {
    "include_history": true,
    "history_limit": 7,
    "include_health": true
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Portfolio snapshot with total USD value, 7-day change, and any persisted position health snapshots.

### Step 2: Run portfolio analytics

Get USD volume breakdowns by type, chain, and recent activity.

```json
{
  "name": "get_portfolio_analytics",
  "arguments": {
    "limit": 500,
    "since_ts": "2026-02-03T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Volume totals by transaction type (swap, send, lend) and by chain. Identifies where capital is most active.

### Step 3: Check open perp positions

Review leverage exposure and liquidation risk.

```json
{
  "name": "get_positions",
  "arguments": {
    "provider": "hyperliquid"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Open positions with size, leverage, entry price, current PnL, and liquidation price. **Red flag:** Position with liquidation price within 5% of current mark price.

### Step 4: Check lending positions

Verify health factor is safe (above 1.5 for conservative risk tolerance).

```json
{
  "name": "get_lending_positions",
  "arguments": {
    "chain": "base"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Supplied collateral, borrowed amounts, health factor. **Red flag:** Health factor below 1.3 (liquidation at 1.0).

### Step 5: Review prediction market exposure

Check active Polymarket positions and outcome probabilities.

```json
{
  "name": "get_prediction_positions",
  "arguments": {
    "chain": "polygon"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Active market positions with current probability and unrealized P&L. **Note:** Prediction markets don't have liquidation risk, but can go to zero if outcome resolves against your position.

</Steps>

## Variations

### Single-chain monitoring

Focus monitoring on one high-activity chain to reduce noise.

```json
{
  "name": "get_portfolio",
  "arguments": {
    "chains": ["solana"],
    "include_history": true
  }
}
```

### Focused position monitoring (perps only)

Skip portfolio overview and jump directly to perp positions if that's your only risk exposure.

```json
{
  "name": "get_positions",
  "arguments": {
    "provider": "hyperliquid"
  }
}
```

Then manually check liquidation prices against current market prices.

## Notes

- **Set up regular cadence:** Run this recipe daily if actively trading, weekly for passive yield farming.
- **Health factor thresholds:**
  - Above 2.0: Very safe
  - 1.5-2.0: Safe for most market conditions
  - 1.2-1.5: Caution zone; add collateral or reduce borrow if volatility increases
  - Below 1.2: High risk; immediate action required
- **Funding rate awareness (perps):** Positive funding means longs pay shorts; negative means shorts pay longs. Check funding rates in `get_market_data` to understand ongoing costs.
- **No liquidation alerts:** Seashail does not auto-alert on liquidation risk. You must manually monitor or build automation on top of these tools.
