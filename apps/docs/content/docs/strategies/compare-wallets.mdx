title: Generated vs Imported Wallets
description: Compare wallet types to decide how to create and manage your wallets.
---

Seashail supports two wallet types: generated wallets (using Shamir secret sharing) and imported wallets (from existing private keys or mnemonics). This comparison helps you choose the right approach.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature        | Generated (Shamir)                    | Imported (Key/Mnemonic)                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Key custody    | Shamir 2-of-3 shares                  | Full key stored locally                          |
| Backup         | Share export (`export_shares`)        | User's responsibility                            |
| Key rotation   | `rotate_shares` available             | Not available                                    |
| Creation       | `create_wallet`                       | `import_wallet`                                  |
| Multi-chain    | Same seed → EVM + Solana + Bitcoin    | Private key: single chain; Mnemonic: multi-chain |
| Account pool   | `create_wallet_pool` for sub-accounts | `add_account` for sub-accounts                   |
| Security model | No single point of failure            | Key compromise = full loss                       |
| Use case       | Primary long-term wallets             | Importing existing wallets                       |

## When to Use Generated Wallets

Generated wallets are recommended for:

- **New wallets** — Creating fresh wallets from scratch
- **Long-term holdings** — Maximum security for assets you plan to hold
- **Highest security** — No single point of failure (2-of-3 threshold)
- **Multi-chain support** — Seamlessly derive addresses for EVM, Solana, and Bitcoin
- **Key rotation** — Ability to regenerate shares without changing addresses

Generated wallets split the root secret into 3 shares using Shamir secret sharing. Any 2 shares can reconstruct the secret, but 1 share alone reveals nothing. Share 1 stays encrypted locally, and you export shares 2 and 3 for backup.

## When to Use Imported Wallets

Imported wallets are recommended for:

- **Existing wallets** — Importing wallets you already use
- **Specific private keys** — Using a single-chain private key (EVM or Solana)
- **Migration** — Moving wallets from MetaMask, Phantom, or other tools
- **Compatibility** — Using a wallet generated by another tool

**Important:** Imported wallets store the full key locally (encrypted with your passphrase). You're responsible for backing up the original key or mnemonic.

## Usage Examples

### Generated Wallet

Create a new generated wallet:

```json
{
  "name": "my-trading-wallet"
}
```

Export shares for backup (after creation):

```json
{
  "wallet": "my-trading-wallet"
}
```

Rotate shares (regenerate all 3 shares):

```json
{
  "wallet": "my-trading-wallet"
}
```

### Imported Wallet (Private Key)

Import an EVM private key:

```json
{
  "name": "imported-metamask",
  "kind": "private_key",
  "private_key_chain": "evm"
}
```

Import a Solana private key:

```json
{
  "name": "imported-phantom",
  "kind": "private_key",
  "private_key_chain": "solana"
}
```

**Note:** The `secret` field is deprecated. Seashail will prompt you to enter the private key securely via an interactive form.

### Imported Wallet (Mnemonic)

Import a BIP-39 mnemonic (multi-chain):

```json
{
  "name": "imported-seed",
  "kind": "mnemonic"
}
```

**Note:** Mnemonics support multi-chain derivation (EVM + Solana + Bitcoin) just like generated wallets.

## Account Management

Both wallet types support sub-accounts:

### Generated Wallets

Create a pool of spending accounts:

```json
{
  "wallet": "my-trading-wallet",
  "count": 5
}
```

This creates 5 new account indexes (BIP-44 derivation) under the same root.

### Imported Wallets

Add a single account:

```json
{
  "wallet": "imported-metamask"
}
```

For imported mnemonics, this derives the next BIP-44 account index.

## Security Considerations

| Aspect                | Generated (Shamir)                                 | Imported                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Passphrase compromise | Attacker needs passphrase + 2 shares               | Attacker needs only passphrase    |
| Share 1 compromise    | Useless without share 2 or 3                       | N/A                               |
| Local storage breach  | 1 share + encrypted key (need 2 more pieces)       | Full key encrypted (need 1 piece) |
| Backup loss           | Can still access with local share + 1 backup share | Must restore from original backup |
