description: Create, secure, and fund a new wallet with policy controls
---

## Overview

Set up a new Seashail wallet from scratch: create with Shamir shares for secure backup, configure policy limits, and fund it for first use.

**Tools used:** `create_wallet`, `export_shares`, `update_policy`, `set_active_wallet`, `get_deposit_info`, `get_balance`
**Chains:** All supported chains
**Time to complete:** 5-10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Seashail installed and daemon running
- Secure storage for backup shares (password manager, paper backup, hardware device)

<Steps>

### Step 1: Create the wallet

Create a new generated wallet using Shamir 2-of-3 secret sharing.

```json
{
  "name": "create_wallet",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "trading-main"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Wallet created with share1 retained by Seashail, shares 2+3 ready for export. Wallet is now active.

### Step 2: Export backup shares

Export shares 2 and 3 for offline storage. Store these in separate secure locations.

```json
{
  "name": "export_shares",
  "arguments": {
    "wallet": "trading-main"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** JSON response with `share2` and `share3` as base64-encoded strings. Copy these immediately to secure storage.

### Step 3: Configure spending policy

Set conservative limits for automated trading.

```json
{
  "name": "update_policy",
  "arguments": {
    "wallet": "trading-main",
    "policy": {
      "max_usd_per_swap": 500,
      "max_usd_per_send": 200,
      "max_usd_per_bridge": 1000,
      "require_confirmation_above_usd": 2000,
      "allowed_chains": ["solana", "base", "arbitrum"],
      "blocked_tokens": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Policy updated. All transactions from this wallet will be subject to these limits.

### Step 4: Get deposit address

Get the Solana deposit address for funding.

```json
{
  "name": "get_deposit_info",
  "arguments": {
    "wallet": "trading-main",
    "chain": "solana",
    "token": "native"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Solana address displayed. Send SOL from an exchange or another wallet to this address.

### Step 5: Verify funding

Check the wallet balance after depositing.

```json
{
  "name": "get_balance",
  "arguments": {
    "wallet": "trading-main",
    "chain": "solana"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Balance shows deposited SOL. Wallet is now funded and ready for trading.

</Steps>

## Variations

### Import existing wallet

Use `import_wallet` instead of `create_wallet` if you have an existing private key or mnemonic.

```json
{
  "name": "import_wallet",
  "arguments": {
    "name": "imported-wallet",
    "kind": "mnemonic"
  }
}
```

Seashail will prompt for the mnemonic via an interactive form (never pass secrets in tool arguments).

### Multi-account setup

Create a pool of spending accounts under one root wallet.

```json
{
  "name": "create_wallet_pool",
  "arguments": {
    "wallet": "trading-main",
    "count": 5
  }
}
```

This creates 5 new account indexes for isolated spending budgets.

## Notes

- **Store shares securely:** Losing both backup shares means you cannot recover your wallet if share1 is lost.
- **Test with small amounts:** Fund with a small amount first to verify addresses are correct.
- **Testnet first:** Consider creating a testnet wallet first (`set_network_mode` to "testnet") to practice the workflow.
- **Policy inheritance:** Wallet-specific policies override the global default policy. Use `get_policy` without arguments to see the global default.
