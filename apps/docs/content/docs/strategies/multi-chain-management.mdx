description: Move capital between chains, swap on destination, and distribute to sub-accounts
---

## Overview

Manage capital across multiple chains: survey balances, bridge tokens between chains, swap to target assets on destination, and optionally distribute to sub-accounts for isolated budgets.

**Tools used:** `get_balance`, `bridge_tokens`, `get_bridge_status`, `swap_tokens`, `transfer_between_wallets`
**Chains:** Solana, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon (example: Solana → Base)
**Time to complete:** 15-30 minutes (includes bridge wait time)

## Prerequisites

- Active wallet with balances on multiple chains
- Destination chain has gas for transactions (ETH on Base, SOL on Solana)

<Steps>

### Step 1: Survey balances across chains

Check balances on all active chains to identify capital allocation.

```json
{
  "name": "get_balance",
  "arguments": {
    "chain": "solana",
    "tokens": ["native", "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v"]
  }
}
```

Repeat for Base, Arbitrum, Polygon. **Expected result:** Balances by chain. Example: 1000 USDC on Solana, 200 USDC on Base.

### Step 2: Identify capital to move

Decide which tokens to bridge and to which chain. **Example:** Move 500 USDC from Solana to Base for DeFi deployment.

### Step 3: Bridge tokens

Execute bridge transaction using Wormhole (native path).

```json
{
  "name": "bridge_tokens",
  "arguments": {
    "chain": "solana",
    "to_chain": "base",
    "token": "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v",
    "amount": "500",
    "amount_units": "ui",
    "bridge_provider": "wormhole",
    "redeem": true
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Transaction signature for Solana bridge initiation. Seashail will auto-redeem on Base when VAA is available.

### Step 4: Monitor bridge status

Poll bridge status until completion. Wormhole typically completes in 5-15 minutes.

```json
{
  "name": "get_bridge_status",
  "arguments": {
    "bridge_id": "5x9z...abc",
    "bridge_provider": "wormhole"
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Status "completed" when tokens arrive on Base. Check destination balance with `get_balance` to confirm.

### Step 5: Swap to target tokens on destination

If you need a different token, swap on the destination chain.

```json
{
  "name": "swap_tokens",
  "arguments": {
    "chain": "base",
    "token_in": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    "token_out": "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006",
    "amount_in": "250",
    "amount_units": "ui",
    "slippage_bps": 100
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** Swapped 250 USDC to WETH on Base.

### Step 6: (Optional) Distribute to sub-accounts

Distribute capital to multiple managed accounts for isolated budgets.

```json
{
  "name": "transfer_between_wallets",
  "arguments": {
    "chain": "base",
    "token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    "amount": "100",
    "amount_units": "ui",
    "from_wallet": "trading-main",
    "from_account_index": 0,
    "to_wallet": "trading-main",
    "to_account_index": 1
  }
}
```

**Expected result:** 100 USDC transferred to account index 1 for isolated spending.

</Steps>

## Variations

### EVM-to-EVM bridging

Bridging between EVM chains (e.g., Arbitrum → Base) is simpler and faster than cross-VM bridging.

```json
{
  "name": "bridge_tokens",
  "arguments": {
    "chain": "arbitrum",
    "to_chain": "base",
    "token": "0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831",
    "amount": "1000",
    "amount_units": "ui",
    "bridge_provider": "wormhole"
  }
}
```

Bridge times are typically 5-10 minutes.

### Consolidation (reverse direction)

Consolidate capital from multiple chains back to one chain. Reverse the steps: bridge from Base/Arbitrum → Solana.

## Notes

- **Bridge times vary:** Cross-VM bridging (Solana ↔ EVM) takes 10-20 minutes. EVM-to-EVM is faster (5-10 minutes).
- **Ensure destination gas:** Before bridging, verify the destination chain has native token for gas. Use `get_balance` with `chain: "base"` and `tokens: ["native"]`.
- **Bridge provider support:** Not all routes support all providers. Wormhole has the broadest coverage; LayerZero is EVM-focused.
- **Wrapped tokens:** Bridged tokens arrive as wrapped versions (e.g., wUSDC). Check token addresses carefully on destination chain.
